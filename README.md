The choice of a profession is very important, since the work should bring profit that satisfies the needs of a person, and while working, a person should feel that he is doing what he wants, and not what he has to do.

>*Working in IT, regardless of whether you work in an office or are a civilian employee, can significantly improve your material well-being and provide a stable income.*

They say that "entering IT" is best through testing - I agree with this thesis, but not because it is easy (it is difficult and stressful), but because from this angle it is best to see all the available areas and opportunities that are hidden behind abbreviation IT.

Starting your career with testing, you can grow into a great developer, experienced business analyst or project manager.

But if you want to remain a tester, that will be COOL too. :innocent:

***Why is it so cool to be a tester?***

- [x] Firstly, testers communicate with developers, businesses and users - and this is a great opportunity to study the product from all sides, understand the situation both from the inside and outside, and at the same time develop soft skills.

- [x] Secondly, we often know the product even better than the developers themselves. Indeed, during the testing process, you have to climb into the farthest corners of the program, press the most cunningly hidden buttons and collect all possible data. We write documentation from scratch, adapt cases, compose bug reports, even look into the source code - which means we know all the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats.

- [x] Thirdly, very often it is the tester who has the final word - whether the product will be released or not. Power (sinister laughter)!
And, of course, responsibility. An incompletely tested product carries risks for the customer, a delay in release incurs additional costs for the contractor, so maintaining a balance is important, and testers are far from being the last people here.

- [x] Fourthly, testers use a great variety of tools in their work - and these are already good steps for self-development and multifunctionality.

>*And, finally, a good QA specialist is an analyst, a manager, a strategist, and even a little developer.*


***Let's consider the career growth of a QA tester in stages.***

:hear_no_evil: *An intern* is a beginner who has learned the basics but has not yet gained any work experience.

:baby: *A newbie* is an employee with little work experience, usually less than six months. He can do simple tests.

:raising_hand_man: :coffee: *A specialist QA tester* is a specialist who knows how to write test scripts, can test the product himself and draw up a verification report. He is also able to analyze the results of improvement in performance and knows how to optimize the development process.

:man_beard: *Senior QA Testers* are experienced professionals who can take charge of complex work.

:nerd_face: *Senior QA-tester* is well versed and knows how to apply different types of testing, can take patronage over newcomers.

:metal: *Lead Engineer* - able to lead a team of engineers, estimate testing times and determine the most effective testing methods.

:muscle: *Developer* - The skills acquired in testing will help the tester create and validate their product.

:handshake: *Management* - if a tester improves managerial skills during work, he can start working with the team. The manager assigns tasks to subordinates and monitors their implementation.

:sunglasses: *The business analyst* is the intermediary between the customer and the team. He knows how to understand business processes and translate tasks into the language of the developers.
